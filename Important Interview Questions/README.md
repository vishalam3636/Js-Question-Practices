❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓

Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.

👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻 Example 1:
Input: x = 121 Output: true Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻 Example 2:
Input: x = -121 Output: false Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻 Example:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4] Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4] Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓

Given a string s consisting of some words separated by some number of spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻 Example 1:
Input: s = "Hello World" Output: 5 Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻 Example 2:
Input: s = " fly me to the moon " Output: 4 Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻 Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4] Output: 5 Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5. Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻 Example 2:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1] Output: 0 Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

❓❓❓❓ Question 5: ❓❓❓❓
❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻 Example 1:
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4] Output: 6 Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻 Example 2:
Input: nums = [1] Output: 1

👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻 Example 3:
Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8] Output: 23
