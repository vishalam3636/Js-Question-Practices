❓❓❓❓ 50-30-20 Strategy ❓❓❓❓

The 50-30-20 strategy is a simple way to budget, which involves spending 50% of after-tax income on needs, 30% after tax income on wants, and 20% after-tax income on savings or paying off debt.

Given the after-tax income as ati, what you are supposed to do is to make a function that will return an object that shows how much a person needs to spend on needs, wants, and savings.

👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻 Examples:
fiftyThirtyTwenty(10000) ➞ { "Needs": 5000, "Wants": 3000, "Savings": 2000 }

fiftyThirtyTwenty(50000) ➞ { "Needs": 25000, "Wants": 15000, "Savings": 10000 }

fiftyThirtyTwenty(13450) ➞ { "Needs": 6725, "Wants": 4035, "Savings": 2690 }
*/

// My Sol-01:
function fiftyThirtyTwenty(ati) {
  let needs = (50 / 100) * ati;
  let wants = (30 / 100) * ati;
  let savings = (20 / 100) * ati;

  return { Needs: needs, Wants: wants, Savings: savings };
}

console.log(fiftyThirtyTwenty(10000)); // {Needs: 5000, Wants: 3000, Savings: 2000}
console.log(fiftyThirtyTwenty(50000)); // {Needs: 25000, Wants: 15000, Savings: 10000}
console.log(fiftyThirtyTwenty(13450)); // {Needs: 6725,Wants: 4035,Savings: 2690}
console.log(fiftyThirtyTwenty(27800)); // {Needs: 13900,Wants: 8340,Savings: 5560}
console.log(fiftyThirtyTwenty(19000)); // {Needs: 9500,Wants: 5700,Savings: 3800}
console.log(fiftyThirtyTwenty(17610)); // {Needs: 8805,Wants: 5283,Savings: 3522}
console.log(fiftyThirtyTwenty(25000)); // {Needs: 12500,Wants: 7500,Savings: 5000}
console.log(fiftyThirtyTwenty(100000)); // {Needs: 50000,Wants: 30000,Savings: 20000}
console.log(fiftyThirtyTwenty(347100)); // {Needs: 173550,Wants: 104130,Savings: 69420}
