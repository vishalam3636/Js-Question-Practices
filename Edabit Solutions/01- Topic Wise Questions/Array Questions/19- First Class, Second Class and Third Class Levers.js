❓❓❓❓ First Class, Second Class and Third Class Levers ❓❓❓❓❓

Levers are simple machines with a rigid beam and a fulcrum. From the picture below, you can see that there are 3-types of levers: first class, second class and third class.

1. In a first class lever, the fulcrum is situated in the middle with the effort and the load being positioned opposite of each other.
2. In a second class lever, the fulcrum is situated in the right with the effort on the left and the load in the middle.
3. In a third class lever, the fulcrum is situated in the left with the effort being in the middle and the load being on the right.

                                [ HERE IS AN HINT IMAGE IN THE QUESTION ]

Given an array that contains the fulcrum "f", the effort "e", and the load "l", write a function that determines whether or not the array shows a first class lever, second class lever, or a third class lever.

👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻 Examples:
determineLever(["e", "f", "l"]) ➞ "first class lever"

determineLever(["e", "l", "f"]) ➞ "second class lever"

determineLever(["f", "e", "l"]) ➞ "third class lever"

📝 :Notes
A pair of scissors is a first class lever, a nutcracker is a second class lever and a broom is a third class lever.

// My Sol-01:
function determineLever(arr) {
  let indOfFul = arr.indexOf("f");

  switch (indOfFul) {
    case 0:
      return "third class lever";
    case 1:
      return "first class lever";
    case 2:
      return "second class lever";
  }

  return indOfFul;
}

console.log(determineLever(["e", "f", "l"])); // "first class lever"
console.log(determineLever(["e", "l", "f"])); // "second class lever"
console.log(determineLever(["f", "e", "l"])); // "third class lever"
